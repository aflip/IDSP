# Extraction and analysis of Integrated disease surveillance project weekly reports

## What is IDSP and its data?

The MOHFW, India since 2009 has been running a national [Integrated Disease Surveiilance Project](https://idsp.nic.in/). 

About 30 infectious and other diseases are covered under this scheme. These are selected on the basis of

1. The likelihood of spread or epidemic propensity/potential
2. The existence of national programs to tackle these illnesses eg. malaria//dengue/ vector borne illnesses
3. The need and possiblity of quick epidemic response being able to treat and contain the illness. 

Every week, the teams spread across india get reports from various levels of the public health system in
India and sends teams to investigate and contain these outbreaks.

It is clear that this data exists in spreadsheets or database-formats before being made into PDFs
and uploaded on the IDSP website, however, I have not been able to gain access to the source data, 
and so this hacky way of getting this data
